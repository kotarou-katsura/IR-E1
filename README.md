#   Inverted Index  and B-tree Builder
Before running the script, make sure the required libraries are installed:

```
pip install pdfplumber spacy BTrees
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
The project uses three sample PDFs to demonstrate how indexing works:

```pdf_files = ['./ow07.pdf', './networking.pdf', './ow04.pdf']```
